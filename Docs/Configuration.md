# Configuration

Configure your controller with the web app at:
https://mon.im/sdvx/config/

You will need Chrome 57+. You must be using SSL (https, not http).
You *might* also need to go to chrome://flags and enable
"Experimental Web Platform features". This step will not be required by
June/July, as the WebUSB feature will be shipping in Chrome 60.

If you are using b\*\*\*\*\*tools, configure as normal.
For fast configuration of the HID lighting, download and run [this exe](https://github.com/mon/PocketVoltex/raw/master/Software/HidLights.exe)
while config.exe is open and the controller is connected.

## KShootMania configuration
I recommend using the mouse+keyboard mode, as I have noticed slight jitter when using joystick mode - it appears to be caused when the knob rolls over from its maximum value to its minimum value. This also lets you bind START to the enter key, which lets you begin songs with the controller.

However, if you would like to use gamepad mode, simply bind the keys as normal (page 3 of the input selection) and select `Analog X/Y` as the knob input. I find sensitivity at 100 works best.

## NetworkError: Unable to claim interface.
This seems to be caused by broken drivers. Give Zadig a try!
