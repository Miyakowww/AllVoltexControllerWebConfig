# Pocket Voltex

A tiny controller for K-Shoot MANIA/Sound Voltex or other similar games

## Project status
There is a major revision coming sometime 2021 but I estimate requires 50+ hours
to complete design. It will significantly improve manufacturing efficiency and hopefully
allow me to sell controllers while working full-time.

Please don't hold your breath on a timely release, but I have not forgotten this
project.
